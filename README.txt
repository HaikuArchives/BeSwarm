BeSwarm is the premier screen saver for BeOS. Featuring incredible highlights like color cycling, heat mapping (tm), hyperspace, a wide range of configuration options this is clearly a users favorite in waisting your precious time looking at the nice effects BeSwarm produces.

BeSwarm is generally speaking a port of xswarm (originally by Jeff Butterworth).
But many extensions make BeSwarm one of the most entertaining screen savers for BeOS. Watch the multitude of BEes chasing one or more wasps (up to eight), changing directions, swarming out and centering in on the target, being surprised by sudden moves and hyperspace jumps of the wasps, and by all that changing colors due to the stress build up. But don´t forget to set your alarm clock so that you don´t forget the time watching at BeSwarm!

All parameters controlling the bees and the wasps are fully configurable, using the Saver configuration panel. All changes are done with a live update of the supplied preview, even if the preview is really to small to behold the beauty of the BeSwarm.
Try it out, and have fun!
